# My Code School Sorting Algorithms Playlist Notes

## Introduction to Sorting Algorithms
 
*Sorting is arranging the elements in a list or collection  
in increasing or decreasing order of some property*  

**e.g.**

*[2, 3, 9, 4, 6]*

- [2, 3, 4, 6, 9] *(Increasing order of value)*
- [9, 6, 4, 3, 2] *(Decreasing order of value)*
- [2, 3, 9, 4, 6] *(Increasing order of number of factors)*

***Sorting Algorithms***

- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Heap sort
- Counting sort
- Radix sort

***Classification***

1. Time complexity
1. Space complexity or memory usag
	- In-place, constant memory
	- Memory usage grows with input size
1. Stability
	- Preserves related order of elements
1. Internal sort vs external sort
	- Internal: All records are in main memory  
	or RAM
	- External: Records are in persistent memory  
	like ssd, hdd, etc.
1. Recursive or non-recursive
	- Recursive: Quick sort, merge sort
	- Non-recursive: Insertion sort, selection sort,  
	and bubble sort
